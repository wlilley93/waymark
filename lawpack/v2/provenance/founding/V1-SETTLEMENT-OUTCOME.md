# V2 Founding Provenance: the settled outcome of the V1 constitutional route

**id:** PROVENANCE-V2-FOUNDING-OUTCOME
**status:** COMMENCED 2026-06-09 - V2 is the live computer-first runtime jurisdiction
**recorded:** 2026-06-09
**supersedes the status of:** the "pending" markers in `HANDOVER.md` (this record states the settled outcome; the HANDOVER remains a draft implementation brief, not authority)

> The V1 constitutional route is now SETTLED. V2 receives that settlement as its founding authority. V2 does not yet have live runtime force: two gates remain, and one of them is a constitutive act of the Sovereign that no agent may perform.

## The settled V1 route

| Step | Outcome | Citation |
|------|---------|----------|
| Privy Council reference judgment | Defined the eight governing questions and the seventeen limits; referred up to the Supreme Court | **[2026] REALM-PC 24** |
| Supreme Court settlement (full court of 9, DECLARATORY, unanimous 9-0) | Settled the migration; **enacted CASE-LAW s. 23(1)-(6)** [constitutional] (the Sovereign-assent floor and AI non-sovereignty); issued the express handover order | **[2026] REALM-SC 10** |
| Standing Committee adoption | Adopted Bill 32 (the Computer-First Realm Act 2026) **4-0** at its second drafting round (after curing the Bill 27 s. 14(2) -> s. 15(2) entrenchment-citation defect); adoption is constitutive | Bill 32 (adopted) |
| Sovereign Assent | GRANTED 2026-06-09: positive, specific, digest-pinned assent (V1 record: Legislature/legislature/2026-06-09-royal-assent-bill-32.md); CASE-LAW s. 23 in force; Bill 32 enacted | done |

**Adopted Bill 32 final-text digest (sha256):** `8e1d3f516cb2aca8e044d8c73bdc6ededa91a47ca86b729eece06f7eee6b9a0c`

## What V2 inherits as binding founding law

1. **The Sovereign-assent floor (CASE-LAW s. 23(1)-(6)), now enacted in V1 and carried into V2 by the migration.** All V2 law, including AI-drafted or delegated law, derives binding force only from Sovereign assent (specific, or standing-bounded under a no-Henry-VIII enabling regime). AI may run the lawmaking machinery and the kernel as clerk but may never be sovereign, expand its competence, sub-delegate, amend the assent rule, or create force from its own output.
2. **The express handover order ([2026] REALM-SC 10).** On satisfaction of the conditions precedent, V2 becomes the self-governing computer-first successor jurisdiction for runtime purposes; V1 remains the Gazette and Archive estate; the V1 courts relinquish continuing runtime control, save the entrenched real-world-law floor. Until each V2 court is expressly constituted, jurisdiction over its matters remains with V1 (no phantom forum).
3. **The deterministic enforcement rule (CASE-LAW s. 23(5)).** The V2 kernel must reject, by an always-on, fail-closed, model-free, affirmative allow-list invariant, any record claiming runtime force without a valid traceable assent source. The existing DRAFT records `SPEC-ASSENT-DRAFT-001`, `INV-ASSENT-DRAFT-001`, and `INV-ASSENT-DRAFT-002` are now backed by settled V1 law and the handover order; they are to be promoted to settled lawpack records as part of commencement, in the affirmative allow-list form the Court mandated.

## Both gates satisfied - V2 COMMENCED 2026-06-09

Per [2026] REALM-SC 10, commencement requires, and no commencement condition may be satisfiable by the V2 machinery alone:

- **Gate A - the Sovereign's positive, specific, digest-pinned assent.** SATISFIED 2026-06-09: the Sovereign granted Sovereign Assent against the digest 8e1d3f51...6b9a0c; CASE-LAW s. 23 is in force and Bill 32 is enacted. The sealed adopted bytes (`bill-32-adopted-final-text.md`, this directory) reproduce the digest.
- **Gate B - the V2 commencement engineering.** SATISFIED 2026-06-09:
  1. The fail-closed Assent-Source Invariant is implemented (kernel predicate `assent_source_valid`, `crates/vjs-core/src/spec.rs`), recorded (`INV-ASSENT-SOURCE-001`, allow-list form superseding the void draft), and PROVEN (`crates/vjs-testkit/tests/assent_source_invariant.rs`, 7/7: missing-field and unresolved-trace rejected; valid forms admitted). Every runtime-force lawpack record carries a valid `assent_source`, so the invariant passes over the whole pack.
  2. The V2 courts are expressly constituted (`2026-VJS-COURTS-CONSTITUTION-001`: County 1, Privy Council 3, Supreme Court 5/9; Court of Appeal persisting, administratively non-convened).
  3. The V2 lawpack (v0.1.0) is validated and locked at sha256 4d2639cc...bb4f; the commencement record `COMMENCEMENT-V2-0001` names the external assent event, the pinned bill digest, the lawpack version, and the lock.

Both gates are satisfied. **V2 has commenced (COMMENCEMENT-V2-0001, 2026-06-09): it is the live computer-first runtime jurisdiction; V1 is the Gazette and Archive estate. The constitutional relay is complete: V1 discovered the law; V2 compiles it.**
