# VDS V1 Specification

**Status: drafted, not commenced.** This text is the normative specification of the Vibe
Design System. It has no assent event behind it yet, so nothing in it binds until it is
enacted by the process at S-15. Clauses marked **RESERVED** depend on a point that is not
settled and must not be implemented until the named submission is answered by VJS.

Citation form for this document: `VDS S-<section>(<clause>)`, for example `VDS S-2(4)`.

## S-1 Nature, purpose and limits

**S-1(1)** VDS is a design-artefact store and a proof producer. It holds registrations,
warrants, proofs, pins, ledgers and referrals for one project's design system, and it runs
deterministic checks over the project's named systems of record.

**S-1(2)** VDS **decides nothing**. It has no bench, no citator, no appeal route and no
power to resolve a contested question. Every judgement call that arises inside VDS is
referred to VJS under S-10. Building a second adjudicator would repeat the mistake that
[2026] VJS-CC-OPBOX 3 forbids in the token layer: a second authority beside one that
already works.

**S-1(3)** In particular VDS may not, by its own force: rule on a contested design
question; grant itself a warrant; declare a proof satisfied that exited non-zero; relax a
floor; adopt a new designpack digest; or accept a surface on the Principal's behalf.

**S-1(4)** VDS exists because a rule stated in prose and enforced by discipline fails
silently. Two measured defects motivate it, and both are of that one class:

- (a) A control-boundary token declared aligned between the decided target and production
  was measured at 1.20:1 against both planes in light, and the shipped checkbox and text
  input therefore failed WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.11 across five themes, worst at 1.15:1 in ember.
  Source: `internal-docs/design/CONTRAST_AUDIT.md` lines 293, 294, 56, 377.
- (b) The declared showpiece screen family was drawn entirely in the outgoing card idiom
  while the doctrine requiring flush panels on a hairline existed only in prose, and
  nothing read that prose.

**S-1(5)** The saving VDS offers is not effort. It is that a defect of that class becomes
a failed proof at authoring time rather than a hand audit months later that finds a live
production accessibility failure.

**S-1(6)** Nothing in VDS adjudicates taste. VDS checks contracts, floors, composition and
parity. Whether a surface is good is reserved to the Principal under S-6(7).

## S-2 The storing line and the deriving line

**S-2(1)** This is the constraint everything else is built inside. [2026] VJS-CC-OPBOX 3
holds that "an artifact that STORES token values is an authority and here would be the
fourth; one that DERIVES and enforces over a named record is a gate and no authority at
all", and permits only the second form.

**S-2(2)** Accordingly: **`.vds/` stores no design values.** It stores registrations,
warrants, proofs, pins, ledgers, referrals and locks.

**S-2(3)** The named systems of record are fixed by [2026] VJS-CC-OPBOX 3 D1 and are not
VDS's to move:

| record | is the system of record for |
|---|---|
| `app/globals.css` | what ships |
| the decided-target Figma file | what is decided |
| the committed snapshot | a derived one-way pin between them, and nothing else |

**S-2(4)** The operative rule. A VDS artefact may hold a **requirement**. It may never hold
a **realisation**. A requirement is a duty imposed from outside the design (a contrast
floor drawn from WCAG, a required state, a prop contract, a keyboard obligation). A
realisation is the design's own answer to that duty (a colour, a length, a radius, a
spacing step, a font family or size, a duration, an easing curve, a shadow). Requirements
come from statute or external law. Realisations come from the named records in S-2(3).

**S-2(5)** The test a reader applies to a proposed artefact. All four limbs must hold, and
a proposed artefact that fails any one of them is in the storing form and is forbidden.

1. **Deletion.** Delete the artefact entirely. If any shipped or decided design value is
   thereby lost, it stored. If everything it held is recomputable by command from
   `app/globals.css`, the Figma file and the codebase, it derived.
2. **Divergence.** Change one named record so the two records disagree. A deriving artefact
   fails closed and says which rows diverged. A storing artefact keeps serving its own
   value and has become a third opinion nobody asked for.
3. **Authorship.** Ask whether a reader can change a shipped pixel by editing only this
   artefact. If yes, it is an authority, whatever it is called.
4. **Regeneration.** A pin or a ledger must be byte-reproducible by a named command from
   the named records. A registration need not be regenerable, because it carries intent
   rather than value, but it must carry no value that a named record also carries.

**S-2(6)** A numeral is not automatically a value. `minRatio: 3.0` in a component record is
a requirement drawn from WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.11 and is lawful under S-2(4). `"#ebebeb"` is a
realisation and is not, wherever it appears in `.vds/`.

**S-2(7) AMENDED, and the original text is recorded because it was wrong.** As drafted this
clause read: "Where a proof must compare two values, it compares digests of the normalised
values, not the values. A pin row therefore carries `source_value_digest` and
`target_value_digest` and an agreement flag, and never the two strings. This is what keeps
the pin a gate rather than a store, and it is why the pin schema forbids a value field."

That construction does not do what the clause says it does, and the difference was measured
rather than argued. An unsalted SHA-256 over a low-entropy domain is not one-way in any
practical sense, and a design token value is a tiny domain: a hex colour is 24 bits, about
16.7 million candidates, and a spacing step or a duration is smaller. An adversarial agent
recovered all 52 values from a 26-row pin in 27 seconds on one CPU. A pin built as the
original clause required therefore STORES the decided and the shipped values, in a form that
is inconvenient to read and trivial to recover, which is exactly the storing form
[2026] VJS-CC-OPBOX 3 forbids. The guard specified at S-2(8) to catch that would have
certified it clean, because it looks for colour literals.

Salting does not rescue it. A salt recorded in the pin is a salt the reader has, so the
search is unchanged. A salt not recorded in the pin makes the pin irreproducible, which fails
the regeneration limb at S-2(5)(4).

**The operative rule is therefore:** a pin row carries the NAME of the thing compared and the
AGREEMENT between the two records, and nothing else. No per-value digest appears anywhere in
`.vds/`. Whether the records as a whole moved is answered by a digest of each whole record,
which is not a low-entropy domain and is safe.

This is a departure from text that is not commenced (S-15) and that mandated a construction
that provably does the opposite of what it claims. It is referred as `SUBMISSION-VDS-006`,
and the fail-closed interim is the rule stated above.

**S-2(8)** The rule S-2(2) actually needs is about **recoverability, not spelling**. An
artefact is in the storing form if a design value can be reconstructed from `.vds/**`,
whether it is written as a literal, an encoding, a digest, an index into an ordered set, or
any other reversible representation. The machine check that enforces S-2(2) is the
`no_stored_values` proof, and it has two limbs, both fatal:

1. **Literal limb.** Any colour literal, length literal, font family, duration or easing
   curve appearing verbatim anywhere under `.vds/**`. This is the limb the specification
   used to have, and on its own it certified the leaking pin clean, because a digest is not
   a literal.
2. **Preimage limb.** Any design value **recovered** from `.vds/**` within the recovery
   budget of S-2(9). The limb enumerates the candidate space, applies each reversible
   transform an artefact could have used, and matches the result against every digest-shaped
   and encoded-looking token harvested from the tree. A single match is a fatal finding
   naming the recovered value and the file it came from.

A guard that passes the very artefact it exists to catch is not a guard, so the preimage
limb, not the literal limb, is the one that decides whether this specification is honest.

**S-2(9)** "Practical" needs an operational definition or the rule is unfalsifiable, so it
gets one. Both quantities below are engineering choices, and moving either is an amendment.

- **Recovery budget: 2^40 evaluations.** About a CPU-day of commodity 2026 hardware. A
  value whose candidate space is smaller than the budget is recoverable, and digesting it
  does not take it out of the storing form. A joint digest is lawful where its preimage
  domain exceeds **2^128**, which is the same statement with the margin an adversary with
  more than a CPU-day deserves.
- **Candidate space: closed and enumerable**, which is what makes the limb decidable rather
  than a matter of opinion. It is exactly: the 2^24 srgb 8-bit colours in each spelling the
  named records use; lengths to three decimal places up to the largest the target record
  declares, in each unit it uses; durations to millisecond granularity up to ten seconds;
  and the font families named in the target record. Design realisations come from a small,
  human-authored, human-readable space, which is precisely why digesting them protects
  nothing.
- **Transform set:** identity, and each of `sha256`, `sha1`, `md5`, hexadecimal and base64,
  applied to each candidate. The set is open to extension and never to reduction. Adding a
  transform can only find more; removing one is a weakening edit under S-8(4).

The proof therefore fails in the direction that matters: seed `.vds/` with a digest of any
one colour and the run must exit non-zero and print that colour back. A `no_stored_values`
implementation that cannot do that has not satisfied S-7(2)(2) and is not a proof.

**S-2(9A) - THE REACH OF LIMB 1, and the adjudicated collision ([2026] VJS-FI-VDS 1,
answering `DECISION-0009`).** Three holdings, on a referral about two findings against a
court record filed under `.vds/court/`.

1. **Scope.** A court record is within the reach of S-2(8). S-2(8) is directory-scoped and
   S-3(9) closes the exceptions at `cache/` and `private/`; no narrowing of the scan by
   directory, by artefact class or by artefact kind is permitted. The question S-2(8) asks
   is never what an artefact IS, it is what can be reconstructed FROM it.
2. **Limb 1 is a floor, not a sufficient test.** A limb-1 match reports that a string is
   SHAPED like a design value. Whether the record is in the storing form is answered by the
   four limbs of S-2(5), which no pattern evaluates. Where all four limbs hold, the match is
   a lexical COLLISION and not a realisation. No tightening of the matcher is available: the
   two readings of such a string are lexically identical, so any predicate that admits the
   collision admits the value. The ruling refuses three named candidate tightenings and says
   why.
3. **The adjudicated collision.** A court may dispose of ONE SITE - one file, at one digest,
   at one line and column, for one limb-1 shape class - having applied the S-2(5) limbs to
   it. A disposal is reported as a warning naming the ruling and counted on the face of the
   record, never suppressed; it dies when the artefact's digest moves; it is fatal if it
   disposes of nothing; and it reaches only `colour_literal`, `length_literal` and
   `duration_literal`, never a field name, an encoding, an undecodable file or a preimage
   recovery. The table is held in the gate, which is `permit_required` under S-3(8) and
   digest-pinned under S-8(1), and not in data under `.vds/`. Two sites are adjudicated.

The ruling also directs, at order 1, that any governance record under `.vds/**` discussing a
realisation names it by CLASS and never quotes it. Two of the four findings in that matter
existed only because the referral quoted the strings it was referring.

## S-3 The three trees

**S-3(1)** VDS separates normative text, this project's record, and engineering
explanation into three physically distinct trees. The split is copied from VJS, where it
is declared rather than incidental.

**S-3(2)** `designpack/v1/` at the repository root holds the normative corpus: `statutes/`,
`regulations/`, `invariants/`, `obligations/`, `orders/`, `judgments/`, `specs/`,
`provenance/`, and `manifest.toml`. It is versioned, digest-pinnable and vendorable on its
own.

**S-3(3)** `.vds/` holds this project's runtime record: `config.toml`, `register/`,
`warrants/`, `proofs/`, `pins/`, `ledgers/`, `submissions/`, `court/convenings/`,
`logs/decisions/`, `logs/breaches/`, `permits/`, `designpack.lock`, `install.lock` and
`enforcement.lock`.

**S-3(4)** `docs/` holds engineering explanation. Nothing in `docs/` binds, and no warrant,
order or invariant may cite it as authority.

**S-3(5)** The normative tree lives outside the dot-directory deliberately. A project
subscribes to a designpack by vendoring it read-only and pinning its digest in
`.vds/designpack.lock`, exactly as a VJS subscriber pins a lawpack. That is what allows a
second project to carry the same doctrine without copying this project's register.

**S-3(6)** A designpack binds exactly ONE project, the one whose `.vds/config.toml` pins
it, and no other - settled by [2026] VJS-CC-VIBE-DESIGN-SYSTEM 4 H3 (answering
`SUBMISSION-VDS-003`). Tenant or realm binding would let one re-pin change law under
sibling projects that never assented, the defect [2026] VJS-CC-VJS 12 condemned in lock
form the same day. Fleet consistency is achieved by every project pinning the same pack
version, divergence made VISIBLE as differing pins and measured by a drift report:
consistency by shared choice, never by remote control.

**S-3(7)** `.vds/config.toml` is the one fixed anchor. Every other path is configurable
from its `[paths]` table by role. The file carries `version`, `jurisdiction_id`,
`repo_code`, `designpack = "<id>@<version>"`, `[paths]`, and `[governance]` with
`permit_required` and `permit_exempt` glob lists.

**S-3(8)** `permit_required` must name, at minimum: `app/globals.css`, the component
library directories, `designpack/v1/**`, `.vds/register/**`, `.vds/config.toml`, and the
proof scripts themselves. The enforcement machinery must not be editable without a permit,
or the gate can be removed by the same hand it constrains. `permit_exempt` covers the
append-only record directories: `.vds/logs/**`, `.vds/permits/**`, `.vds/proofs/**`.

**S-3(9)** The record is committed, not scratch. Only `.vds/cache/` and `.vds/private/` are
ignored. A governance record that is gitignored is not a record.

---

## S-4 The artefact set

**S-4(1)** VDS holds exactly ten artefact kinds (nine before the retention log was enacted at S-4(5)). Seven have a JSON Schema under `schema/`,
and a file that does not validate against its schema is not an artefact of that kind. The
remaining two, the decision log and the breach report, are ADOPTED from VJS and are validated
against VJS's schemas rather than redefined here; saying "each has a schema under `schema/`"
was wrong, because two of the nine never did.

The schemas under `schema/` are GENERATED from the implementation's types and are not maintained
beside them. A hand-written schema and a hand-written parser are two opinions about one
shape, and two opinions drift; `vds schema check` regenerates and diffs, so a divergence is
a failing check rather than a discovery months later.

The ninth kind, the SCREEN RECORD, was added by amendment on 2026-07-30 under S-7(6). The
reason is recorded at S-5A(1) and is not a matter of completeness: every artefact kind before
it described a COMPONENT, so a page could render only registered components, each in an
enforceable status, arranged in a way its frame does not draw, and every proof stayed green.

| artefact | path | schema | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| component record | `.vds/register/<id>.yaml` | `component-record.schema.json` | one registered component, its contract and its lineage |
| screen record | `.vds/screens/<id>.yaml` | `screen-record.schema.json` | one governed screen and the ARRANGEMENT it requires |
| warrant | `.vds/warrants/<id>.yaml` | `warrant.schema.json` | a stage gate granted on an evidence digest |
| proof result | `.vds/proofs/<id>.yaml` | `proof-result.schema.json` | machine output a warrant was granted against |
| pin | `.vds/pins/<id>.yaml` | `pin.schema.json` | a derived one-way agreement assertion between two named records |
| enforcement lock entry | `.vds/enforcement.lock` | `enforcement-lock-entry.schema.json` | a digest pin of one proof script, plus what invokes it |
| submission | `.vds/submissions/{draft,filed,docket}/<id>.yaml` | `submission.schema.json` | a question referred to VJS and the order that answered it |
| decision log | `.vds/logs/decisions/<id>.yaml` | (VJS log schema, adopted) | a reversible call, recorded not adjudicated |
| breach report | `.vds/logs/breaches/<id>.yaml` | (VJS breach schema, adopted) | a self-reported failure and its restorative remedy |

**S-4(2)** Ledgers (`.vds/ledgers/`) are generated inventories, never hand-edited. Each
ledger must have a staleness test that fails when its source changed and the generator was
not re-run. A ledger with no staleness test decays, and the evidence for that is in this
project already.

**S-4(3)** Permits (`.vds/permits/`) are adopted from VJS unchanged in form and meaning,
including the standing note carried on every self-issued permit: self-issue proves the
actor took the front door and is not an external authority's approval, and cannot satisfy
a check reserved to the Sovereign or to a constituted bench.

**S-4(4)** All identifiers are allocated by reading the live record off disk and taking the
maximum plus one. No identifier may be asserted by hand or held in memory across a run. A
collision is a fail-closed validation error, never a silent overwrite. VJS deleted an
in-memory citation registry for exactly this defect: it restarted every series at genesis.

**S-4(5)** The RETENTION LOG is the tenth artefact kind, enacted by
[2026] VJS-CC-VIBE-DESIGN-SYSTEM 6, and it is the only lawful exhaust of the only delete
power in the toolchain. `vds prune` operates on the WORKING SET, not on the record: git is
the append-only store behind `.vds/`, which is what makes pruning housekeeping rather than
destruction. The keep-rules are these, on the statute's face and not in the tool's help
text: the most recent record per proof kind is kept (D2, D3, D7 and D8 each settle on it);
every FAILURE is kept; anything a warrant cites is kept; and every removal is written to
the retention log, which lives in `.vds/`, is schema-governed like its nine siblings, and
is never pruned by the run it explains. Prune never runs unattended - it stays out of every
automated path, held there by an enforced test, because deletion is an act a person
initiates with these rules in front of them.

---

## S-5 The register

**S-5(1)** The register is what turns "confine design to the library" from a wish into a
checkable condition. Without it the composition proof at S-7 has nothing to check against.

**S-5(2)** One record per component, per `schema/component-record.schema.json`. The
load-bearing fields:

| field | why it is there |
|---|---|
| `id`, `name`, `status` | the lifecycle position, S-5(4) |
| `contractVersion` | so an amendment is a versioned event, not a silent edit |
| `figma` | file key and node id in the decided-target file |
| `code` | import path, source file and export name, or null if unbuilt |
| `props` | the contract, so Figma variants and code props are comparable |
| `states` | which of the nine states are required, which are drawn, which are built |
| `a11y` | role, accessible-name source, keyboard contract, and the contrast floors that bind it |
| `demand` | how many routes consume it, measured by a named command, so build order is evidence-led |
| `supersedes` / `supersededBy` | so retirement is traceable, S-9 |
| `amendments` | the contract's own history |

**S-5(3)** The nine states are fixed: `default`, `hover`, `focus`, `active`, `selected`,
`disabled`, `loading`, `error`, `success`. A component record may require a subset. It may
not invent a tenth.

**S-5(4)** The status lifecycle is a directed path and skipping is forbidden:

```
proposed -> designed -> registered -> built -> verified -> deprecated -> retired
```

`registered` means the contract is complete and binding. `verified` means a parity proof
passed against the built counterpart. `deprecated` and `retired` are governed by S-9.

**S-5(5)** A hand-maintained register decays. The measured evidence: this project's
`component-map.json` carries 56 component entries, while `src/components/ui` and
`src/components/onyx` together hold 90 `.tsx` files. Those are not the same measurement,
and one entry may legitimately cover several files, but nothing today derives either number
from the other or reconciles them. That gap is precisely where a register rots.

**S-5(6)** Therefore the register is reconciled by proof, in both directions, and the
reconciliation is a gate. A `reconciliation` proof (S-7) must report: register entries with
no resolvable code counterpart; code components in the governed library directories with no
register entry; register entries whose Figma node id does not resolve in the pinned file;
and prop or state contracts that disagree between the record and the code. Any non-empty
set is a violation.

**S-5(7)** `demand` is measured, never estimated. The record carries the command that
measured it and the timestamp. A `demand` figure older than its ledger's generation is
stale and the reconciliation proof says so.

**S-5(9) - ENACTED 2026-08-01 as amended, [2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 orders 15-18 (SUBMISSION-VDS-015).** A
registered record that a directive stands behind must be MEASURED BY something, and the
measure must read the work. Three limbs:

1. A record may carry `measuredBy` (the gates, proofs or readers that hold its
   conformance), `directedAt` (when the directive was given) and `graceDays` (how long it
   may stand unmeasured). The grace is the project's to declare; that expiry is fatal is
   VDS's.
2. A directed record whose `measuredBy` is EMPTY after its grace goes red
   (`register_completeness` R2). The defect this closes was observed on the subscriber
   project: rule rows registered with nothing measuring them stayed green forever, which
   is how twenty-eight gates coexisted with pages that looked nothing like their frames.
3. A measure pointing at a plan or documentation artefact (`internal-docs/`, a `*.md`
   plan, a README) is INVALID (`register_completeness` R3). A rule measured by a plan is
   measured by prose, and the plan can promise anything while the row stays green.
   Measures read shipped code or rendered artefacts.

4. **(Order 16.)** Every measure must RESOLVE: to the name of a proof kind in the closed
   registry at S-7(5), to a repository-relative path that exists in the subject tree, or to
   a path pinned in the enforcement lock. An entry resolving to nothing is refused (R4), and
   R3's refusal of document paths stands alongside it. The rule is an ALLOWLIST and never a
   denylist of document-shaped strings: without resolution, R2 is discharged by typing a
   word, and `measuredBy: "the enhancement charter"` passed every check the denylist had.
5. **(Order 17.)** Every run REPORTS the records outside the clause: an enforceable record
   carrying neither `measuredBy` nor `directedAt` is counted, and named where there are
   twelve or fewer (I4). Such a record is not a failure; it is COVERAGE OWED. A rule that
   fires only on the rows that armed it has a denominator, and an unreported denominator is
   the defect this clause was written against.
6. **(Order 18.)** The scope note of `register_completeness` reads "existence, and the
   measurement coverage of a directed record". The widening is recorded here and in that
   proof's enforcement-lock entry, and is never left standing in a scope note the proof has
   outgrown.

The clock is a ledger's generation moment, never the wall clock (S-7(2)(1)). Records
carrying neither field predate the clause and are outside it: the clause reaches what was
DIRECTED, and does not retroactively redden the register.

---

## S-5A The screen register

**S-5A(1)** The register at S-5 governs COMPONENTS, and parity is a claim about SCREENS. That
gap is not a matter of coverage, it is structural: with a component register alone, a page
that renders only registered components, each in an enforceable status, in an arrangement its
frame does not draw, passes every proof at S-7(5)(1) to (10). The evidence is a real one. In
the subject this amendment was drawn from, a route was marked complete on 2026-07-30 while
rendering a whole extra column its Figma frame does not draw, and nothing in VDS could have
seen it, because the two proof kinds that say the word "screen" read a screen's REFERENCES
(which components it names, at which line) and never its arrangement.

**S-5A(2)** One record per governed screen, per `schema/screen-record.schema.json`. The
record holds: the screen's own name for itself (a route, a path), a lifecycle status from
S-5(4), the frame in the decided-target file that DRAWS it, and an arrangement contract.

**S-5A(3)** The arrangement contract holds a COUNT of side-by-side content panes, a list of
region NAMES, and (under S-7D(14)) an optional list of the CLOSED review BANDS the screen has.
The two lists are not duplicates of one another: region names are the subject's own open
vocabulary, and the band list exists because a correspondence check needs a vocabulary that
can refuse a name. It may not hold a width, a height or any other length, because S-2(4) admits a
requirement and refuses a realisation and a width is the design's own answer. The prior art
this is drawn from records a frame's columns as `[924, 420]`; under `.vds/**` that is the
storing form S-2(2) prohibits, `no_stored_values` would fail on it, and it would go on failing
forever on a file VDS wrote itself, because a record is never deleted (S-9(1)).

**S-5A(4)** A screen with no split requires ONE column and never zero. One register for both
sides: where the two halves of a comparison count different things, agreement reads as a
deviation, and the prior art scored a route `frame=0 code=1` for agreeing. A contract of zero
columns is refused by the proof under S-7(2)(4), because no arrangement can render fewer than
zero panes and a requirement nothing can fail is not a requirement. A contract above the
ceiling the implementation fixes is refused for the twin reason: a row that can never pass is
the one people route around, and they take the other checks with them.

**S-5A(5)** The AUTHORITY of a frame is read from its layer names, and a frame is not one
drawing. It carries several and says which one governs. The vocabulary belongs to the project
that drew it and is configured, never fixed here; fixing it would make VDS an authority on
what a design file may call its own layers, which is the fourth authority
[2026] VJS-CC-OPBOX 3 forbids. A frame may also DISCLAIM ITSELF, saying in its own name that
it is not source-current or was never built. Such a frame states no contract, and a difference
measured against one is real and means nothing.

**S-5A(6)** The frame ledger is generated out of band from a SAVED capture and is a ledger
under S-4(2), with a staleness test. It records the CAPTURE DEPTH it derived and marks every
reading taken at that boundary. This is not caution. A Figma response carries no flag saying a
subtree was cut off, so a childless node at the capture depth and a genuinely empty one are
the same bytes, and only the depth asked for knows the difference. "The frame draws nothing
here" and "we did not look" may not be the same value, and a reading taken at the boundary may
not be enforced against.

**S-5A(7)** COVERAGE IS PART OF THE RESULT. The screen proof reports, per run, how many
registered screens were SCORED, how many were UNSCORED, and how many were EXCLUDED, and a run
whose tally does not account for every screen it considered is a precondition failure rather
than a pass. UNSCORED means a requirement exists and the run could not measure it, and every
one is a violation. EXCLUDED means the DESIGN states nothing to measure against, which is a
different fact and is not a failure. The rule exists because a screen gate that measures the
routes it happens to understand and prints a clean pass is the exact failure this whole
capability was added to prevent: the prior art's own gate scored 32% of routes and would have
reported zero deviations while 75 routes with a real multi-column contract were never compared
once.

**S-5A(8)** The CODE side is a seam and not a rule. A route's column count is the SUM of the
contribution of every node on the path from the route entry to the leaf: the innermost layout
component, every enclosing layout, and any shell whose count is fixed in the component rather
than in a prop. Reading that requires parsing the subject's own layout components and there is
no general answer, so the implementation states an interface a subject implements and VDS sums
what it returns. A node the subject cannot read makes the total UNKNOWN and the screen
UNSCORED, never a smaller number: contributing zero for a node nobody understood is
indistinguishable from a node that genuinely adds nothing, and the screen would then be scored
against a total that is quietly too low and passed.

## S-6 Warrants and the staged lifecycle

**S-6(1)** A warrant is an operative record: what was granted, on what evidence digest, by
whom, when, and what it unlocks. Its shape is the VJS order shape, per
`schema/warrant.schema.json`. Long rationale lives in `designpack/v1/judgments/`, so the
warrant itself stays short enough to load at runtime.

**S-6(2)** The four stages, in strict order. A stage may not be entered before the
preceding warrant is `granted`, and the ordering is the entire mechanism: every drift
defect measured in this project was authored before anyone asked whether the thing being
used was registered.

| warrant | granted on this evidence | granted by | unlocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| **W1 REGISTER-COMPLETE** | `register_completeness` proof exit 0 and `reconciliation` proof exit 0, both non-vacuous, over the declared surface | VJS on a referred submission | design may begin |
| **W2 DESIGN-COMPLETE** | `composition` exit 0 over every declared screen, plus `states` exit 0 and `contrast` exit 0 | the bench, per S-6(6) | Principal review |
| **W3 PRINCIPAL-ACCEPTED** | a dated, digest-pinned acceptance event in `designpack/v1/provenance/assent/` | the Principal alone, S-6(7) | parity work may begin |
| **W4 PARITY** | `parity` exit 0 for every registered component, plus `token_pin` and `contrast` re-run against the shipped CSS | VJS on a referred submission | the system is done |

**S-6(3)** Every warrant names `case_file_digest`, the sha256 of the evidence file it was
granted against, and every proof it relies on by id and digest. A warrant carrying no
evidence entry is a signature on nothing and is void on its face.

**S-6(4)** A warrant is spent when the surface it was granted over changes. Adding a screen
after W2, or a component after W1, does not inherit the warrant: the proof re-runs and the
warrant is re-granted or refused. `status: spent` is recorded, never deleted.

**S-6(5)** On a greenfield surface, W1 may be granted over a DECLARED SUBSET of the
register, the subset named by digest in the grant itself - settled by
[2026] VJS-CC-VIBE-DESIGN-SYSTEM 4 H1 (answering `SUBMISSION-VDS-001`). The grant's claim
stays exact: these records, at these digests, are complete, and drift stays structurally
impossible INSIDE the subset. Touching a record outside the subset is work the grant does
not cover, and widening the subset is a NEW grant, never a drifted old one. No provisional
registration awaiting ratification exists: deferred enforcement is banked debt, and
nothing in a provisional grant forces the ratification to ever happen.

**S-6(6)** W2 DESIGN-COMPLETE is granted by the bench, referred to VJS like W1 and W4 -
settled by [2026] VJS-CC-VIBE-DESIGN-SYSTEM 4 H2 (answering `SUBMISSION-VDS-002`). The
proofs ARE the case file, so a sitting over green proofs is short: machine-checkable
evidence lowers the COST of the bench and never replaces it, because the question a grant
answers is not "are the proofs green" but "is this claim to completeness the right claim
to certify". A self-granted warrant is the laundering vector the VJS assent-resolution
line closed, and twice this programme found a green suite whose gate could not fail - a
bench reading the seeded failing directions is what catches that class. VDS may record a
proof-only candidate; it may never treat one as granted.

**S-6(7)** W3 is the Principal's and no one else's. Acceptance is reserved to the Sovereign
under ACT-001:s2. No proof substitutes for it, no bench may grant it, and VDS may never
infer acceptance from silence. The acceptance event carries the digest of exactly what was
accepted, so a later claim that a screen was accepted is checkable against the bytes.

**S-6(8)** VJS adjudicates whether W1, W2 and W4 are earned on the evidence. It does not
adjudicate taste, and a submission that asks it to is defective.

---

## S-7 What makes a proof valid

**S-7(1)** The ratio that forces this section, from [2026] VJS-CC-OPBOX 3: "a gate that no
build invokes, over a contract in which no row is in an enforceable state, is not
enforcement and cannot be relied on as the reason not to consolidate."

**S-7(2)** A proof is valid only if all five conditions hold. A check failing any of them
is not a proof and may not be named as evidence for a warrant.

1. **Re-runnable.** One named command, deterministic, no network call, no model call. Same
   inputs give the same output and the same digest.
2. **Falsifiable.** It exits non-zero on a violation, **and** a named test seeds a violation
   against a fixture and asserts the non-zero exit. A check whose failing direction is
   asserted nowhere has proven only its happy path. The enforcement lock entry cannot be
   written without naming that test, which is how the condition is enforced rather than
   requested.
3. **Invoked.** Something runs it that is not the author choosing to run it. The invocation
   is declared in the enforcement lock entry.
4. **Non-vacuous.** It reports `rows_considered` and `rows_enforced` and warns when
   `rows_enforced` is zero. A pass over zero enforceable rows is recorded with
   `status: vacuous`, never `passed`. This is the exact defect [2026] VJS-CC-OPBOX 3 D3
   found: a printed drift PASS while 32 of 34 mapped tokens were `migrating`, 2 were
   `floor`, none was `aligned`, and the checker skipped both branches.
5. **Captured automatically.** The proof record is written by the checker as a side effect
   of running. A hand-written proof record is void, and the schema enforces this by fixing
   `capture_mode` to the single value `automatic`.

**S-7(3)** A hook is not CI. `git commit --no-verify` bypasses a local hook, and an author
with write access can edit a gate and re-pin it. Condition S-7(2)(3) is satisfied by a
remote check that re-runs the same deterministic gate on the pushed diff. A local hook
alone satisfies it only as an interim state, and the interim must be recorded.

**S-7(4)** Measured state of this project's two design gates at the time of drafting:
`scripts/design-token-gate.py` and `scripts/design-structure-gate.py` are invoked from
`.githooks/pre-push` at lines 106 and 123, and from 0 of the 10 workflows in
`.github/workflows/`. So they meet S-7(2)(3) on the hook limb and not on the CI limb, and
that is the honest description of where they stand.

**S-7(5)** The proof kinds are a closed registry. A proof of any other kind is not a proof.

| kind | what it establishes |
|---|---|
| `register_completeness` | every component referenced by any declared screen exists in the register |
| `reconciliation` | the register agrees with Figma and with the codebase, both directions, S-5(6) |
| `composition` | no screen uses an unregistered component; the anti-drift proof |
| `contrast` | every registered component's boundaries clear their floors in every theme |
| `states` | every required state of every registered component is drawn |
| `parity` | each registered component's code counterpart matches its props and states contract |
| `token_pin` | the two named records agree where the pin declares them aligned |
| `retirement_drain` | a component proposed for retirement has zero remaining consumers, S-9 |
| `ledger_staleness` | each generated ledger is current with its source, S-4(2) |
| `no_stored_values` | `.vds/**` holds no realisation AND yields none under the S-2(9) recovery test, S-2(8) |
| `screen_parity` | each registered screen's required arrangement is the one its authoritative frame draws, S-5A |
| `geometry` | each registered surface's SHAPE - radius, boundary weight, density, type scale - is the one the design system specifies, and the count of surfaces that do not comply is BOUNDED AND FALLING, S-7A |
| `prohibition` | each registered pattern is ABSENT from its enumerated scope, and the scope has not narrowed since it was recorded, S-7B (ENACTED unamended, [2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 order 10) |
| `burndown` | each pinned metric reads exactly its pin: any increase is red, and a decrease not re-pinned is red too, S-7C (ENACTED as amended, [2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 orders 12-14) |
| `visual_review` | each recorded visual verdict still holds: shipped screenshot against SIGNED frame, stale the moment either side or the authority moves, S-7D (ENACTED as amended, [2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 orders 19-22) |

The eleventh kind was added by amendment on 2026-07-30, by the route S-7(6) requires. The
first ten all read a COMPONENT; `register_completeness` and `composition` say "screen" and
read a screen's REFERENCES. So the arrangement of a page was checked by nothing, and S-5A(1)
records the defect that made that visible.

The twelfth kind was added by amendment on 2026-07-31, by the same route, and it closes the
same class of hole one level further down. The first eleven answer WHICH components a
surface uses, in WHAT state, and in WHAT arrangement. None of them answers what the surface
LOOKS LIKE. A page can compose only registered components, each in an enforceable status,
arranged exactly as its frame draws, and still read as the outgoing design, because radius,
boundary weight, density and type scale are none of those things.

S-7A records the defect that made it visible, and it is not hypothetical. On the subscriber
project the token layer was migrated to a new palette across six themes, every proof went
green, three separate progress numbers read high - 95.6% adoption, 193/199 routes, 0 owed
column deviations - and the application looked substantially unchanged to the person who
commissioned the work. The paint had moved and the shape had not: 561 hand-rolled
card-geometry containers, 376 legacy rule blocks and 385 files importing the outgoing
component library were all invisible to every proof in the registry.

The thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth kinds were drafted on 2026-08-01 and ENACTED the
same day by [2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 (Court of Appeal; Fidelity, Engine and Estate JJ), five of
the six submissions as amended. The registry is CLOSED AT FIFTEEN and no sixteenth kind was
created: the measurement-coverage clause is housed in `register_completeness` by order 15,
against Engine J's dissent, which is recorded in Schedule B of that judgment.
They are drawn from the same migration's post-mortem, one level further out. The twelve
enacted kinds could hold the structure of a page to its frame and the shape of its
surfaces to a falling bound; none of them could hold a PATTERN absent from a place
(S-7B), consolidate the bespoke ratchet scripts every consuming repo had grown (S-7C), or
hold the RENDERED PAGE to the SIGNED FRAME through anything but structure (S-7D). And
S-7D carries a constitutional direction of its own: the signed-off Figma DEFINES taste,
exercised once, at sign-off - which REPEALS the acceptance doctrine the earlier
adjudication rulings had adopted, and says so in the submission rather than smuggling it.

### S-7A GEOMETRY, AND WHY A PIN IS NOT A PROOF

**S-7A(1)** The defect. A design system is adopted in two parts and only one of them is
easy to measure. The PAINT - which token a surface references - is a name, and a name is
trivially checkable. The SHAPE - corner radius, boundary weight, control density, spacing
step, type scale - is what a person actually sees, and no proof in this registry read it
until this amendment.

The consequence is specific and was observed: swapping one dark-neutral palette for another
dark-neutral palette is a real change that is nearly invisible, while the geometry that
carries the visual identity stays exactly where it was. Every instrument reported progress.
The product looked the same. Both were true.

**S-7A(2)** A geometry proof MUST state a bound and that bound MUST fall. This is the
operative clause and it exists because of how the defect survived after being found.

The subscriber project HAD a shape instrument before this amendment: a ratchet holding the
count of non-compliant containers at its current value so it could not rise. It reported
"561 hand-rolled card-geometry containers, pin 561". That is a floor, and a floor is a
different instrument from a target. A number that may only be held can never fall, and this
one did not: it moved from 667 to 561 through work done for other reasons, then stopped.

So: a `geometry` proof carries a bound and a DIRECTION. Refuse the proof if the bound was
not lowered within the declared window. A ratchet that never tightens is a record of a
defect, presented as a control.

**S-7A(3)** The bound is per SURFACE KIND, not one number for the estate. "561" names no
work: it cannot be assigned, it cannot be finished, and it hides which surfaces are worst.
The proof partitions by the shape being violated - radius, boundary weight, density, type
scale - so each row is a job somebody can pick up and drive to zero.

**S-7A(4)** Geometry is read from the SHIPPED artefact, never from a model of it. A code
model of the intended design is a legitimate design tool and is NOT admissible as the
subject of this proof: it is a third artefact that drifts, and on the subscriber project a
17-page code model of the design drifted so completely that it now models the OUTGOING
system it was built to replace. The proof reads what ships. The frames remain the target.

**S-7A(5) - ENACTED 2026-08-01 as amended, [2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 orders 5-9 (SUBMISSION-VDS-012).** The
TWO-SIDED binding. The reading at S-7A(4) measures what shipped; this clause binds it to
what was DECIDED. An authority snapshot - generated out of band from a saved REST capture
of the signed frame's node values, because a proof may not call the network (S-7(2)(1)) -
records, per surface kind, an AGREEMENT BIT and never a value (the S-2(7) pin discipline),
plus the input hash of each side: the capture's digest and the reading's content digest.
The proof holds while both hashes still match what is on disk and the agreement bits are
true; it goes STALE, visibly and fatally, the moment either side's input hash changes. A
silently green stale binding is the 561-pin-561 instrument again, and the staleness rule
is the whole reason the snapshot exists. The snapshot's frame is subject to S-7D
authority: agreement claimed against an unsigned frame is refused.

**S-7A(5B) - THE COMPARATOR ([2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 orders 6 to 9).** The snapshot NAMES the
comparator that produced its agreement rows (`comparator`, repository-relative) and that
file's digest at comparison time (`comparatorDigest`), both entering the content digest.
`vds ledger geometry-authority` refuses a snapshot whose comparator cannot be read or whose
digest differs from the file on disk, in the same terms it already refuses a stale capture
or reading. **R14**: the COMPARATOR side is stale where that file cannot be read or no
longer digests to `comparatorDigest` - fatal, no row enforced, reported alongside R12's two
sides. The reason is that the engine cannot re-derive an agreement bit: re-deriving needs
the values, which S-2(2) and [2026] VJS-CC-OPBOX 3 forbid it to hold, so the one input that
decides the verdict was the one input carrying no witness at all. **W3**: where the
comparator does not appear in the project's enforcement lock carrying a failing-direction
test, every run warns and recites that `agrees` is an assertion the engine cannot falsify,
and that no warrant may claim primacy for this limb over a repo-local gate on the same
ground ([2026] VJS-SC-OPBOX 1 orders 2 and 3).

**S-7A(5A) - DRAFT AMENDMENT of 2026-08-01, ENACTMENT PENDING (SUBMISSION-VDS-019).** The
agreement row is THREE-VALUED, never two: per surface kind the comparator records `agrees`,
`disagrees`, or `not_drawn`. `not_drawn` means the signed frame draws nothing on that
dimension; it resolves to no_authority for that surface kind and can never contribute
conformance, because a frame binds only for what it draws in the states it draws, and a
comparator that finds nothing to compare and reports agreement manufactures conformance out
of silence ([2026] VJS-SC-OPBOX 1 orders 6 and 14). A snapshot whose rows are all
`not_drawn` is a binding nothing can fail and is refused under S-7(2)(4). This was Fidelity
J's amendment 012-A, recorded at Schedule B item 1 of [2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 as commanding one
judge and therefore NOT CARRIED; it is implemented behind SUBMISSION-VDS-019 on this lane's
standing posture - the code ships marked as drafted, and no warrant may cite it until the
ruling lands.

**S-7A(5D) - NO PRIMACY CONFERRED ([2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 order 2; declaratory of
[2026] VJS-SC-OPBOX 1 orders 2 to 5).** Nothing in this clause, or in S-7B, S-7C or S-7D,
confers primacy. No warrant may claim primacy for a kind enacted or amended by
[2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1, and no repo-local gate may be retired in reliance on one, until that
kind has been shown to run RED by negative control against a seeded violation of the
specific incident class the gate was forged against, ON THE REPOSITORY CONCERNED and not
only in this engine's synthetic harness, with the seed recorded in that repository's
`.vds/enforcement.lock` where the enforcement instrument reads it. Until that demonstration
both instruments run, the stricter reading enforces, and any disagreement between them is
itself filed. This clause is written into the statute rather than left in the judgment
because the consuming repository reads the statute.

### S-7B PROHIBITION - ENACTED 2026-08-01 unamended, [2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 orders 10-11 (SUBMISSION-VDS-013)

**S-7B(1)** A prohibition asserts a pattern ABSENT from an ENUMERATED scope. This is the
instrument for the "no container radius in body regions" / "no dotfield behind main
areas" class of directive, which on the subscriber project's migration lived as prose
beside twenty-eight gates that could not read it. Prose is not enforcement.

**S-7B(2)** The scope is an explicit file list or a glob, and the glob's EXPANSION at
registration is recorded in the record. A recorded file the globs no longer reach is a
fatal finding, never a disappearance: without the recorded expansion, a file renamed out
of the glob takes its violations with it and the pass over the smaller population reads
exactly like a pass over the original. Growth past the recorded expansion is scanned AND
warned, so a new file is never an unenforced shadow while the baseline catches up.

**S-7B(3)** Failure NAMES THE SURVIVING SITES, file and line. A count names no work.

**S-7B(4)** A prohibition that cannot fail is refused: an empty pattern, or a scope whose
recorded expansion is empty, is not a control but the appearance of one (S-7(2)(4)).

### S-7C BURNDOWN - ENACTED 2026-08-01 as amended, [2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 orders 12-14 (SUBMISSION-VDS-014)

**S-7C(1)** A burndown pins a NUMERIC READING whose only lawful direction is down. It
consolidates the pattern every consuming repo had grown as its own bespoke ratchet
script, each with its own storage and its own quiet way of rotting.

**S-7C(2)** The pin must SIT ON the measured value. Red on ANY increase, because the pin
is the last measurement and not an allowance above it. Red ALSO on a decrease that was
not re-pinned in the same change: a stale floor measures the next regression from the
wrong place, and a metric that fell forty under its pin has forty regressions of
invisible headroom. Green means exactly one thing - the pin is the truth.

**S-7C(3)** A deadline, where directed, is measured against the reading's `taken_at` and
never the wall clock (S-7(2)(1)). Past it, a non-zero metric is red until zero or until
the undertaking is renegotiated as a NEW record with the reason on it.

**S-7C(4)** A raised pin is refused wherever it appears in the history, on S-7A(2)'s
reasoning: the lawful route to a higher number is a deprecation and a new baseline.

**S-7C(5) - THE INDEPENDENT CLOCK ([2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 order 13).** A deadline may not be
deferred by a reading that stopped moving. A burndown record carrying a deadline MUST also
declare a maximum reading age in days, and the proof is fatal where the reading's `takenAt`
precedes, by more than that many days, the most recent `generatedAt` among the ledgers the
run read. The clock is never the wall clock (S-7(2)(1)); it is the run's own freshest
independent input, so a subject that stops regenerating the reading cannot thereby outlive
the undertaking that reading witnesses. A deadline whose only clock is the input it gates
is a deadline the subject sets. S-7C(3)'s measurement against the reading's own moment is
otherwise UNDISTURBED (order 14): that discipline is what keeps a dated fence from
producing different findings from identical inputs.

### S-7D VISUAL REVIEW, FRAME SIGN-OFF, AND THE END OF DOWNSTREAM TASTE - ENACTED 2026-08-01 as amended, [2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 orders 19-33 (SUBMISSION-VDS-016, -017)

**S-7D(1)** The constitutional direction (Principal, 2026-08-01): the signed-off Figma
DEFINES taste. Taste is exercised once, at frame sign-off, and deviations are not
adjudicated downstream. Everything in this section is that sentence made mechanical.

**S-7D(2)** THE SIGN-OFF REGISTER. A sign-off row records the file key, the node id, the
frame's CONTENT HASH at sign-off, the signer, and the date. Authority for any frame-bound
proof exists ONLY while the frame's current content hash matches a sign-off row. A frame
edited after sign-off reverts to UNSIGNED until re-signed, however senior the last
signer: staleness is by hash, never by trust. VDS records who signed and never decides
who may sign; granting is not the engine's to do (S-1(3)).

**S-7D(3)** AUTHORITY STATES. The verdict vocabulary of every frame-bound proof is
`conform | deviate | no_authority`, closed at three. `no_authority` - the frame unsigned,
parked, a proposal, or changed since sign-off - is a DISTINCT state: never green, never
red, reported as coverage owed. A proof cannot claim conformance against an unsigned
frame; the claim is refused at validation, because green-against-nothing is the one
combination that would smuggle taste back downstream.

**S-7D(4) - NO ACCEPTANCE STATE (enacted as amended, [2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 orders 23, 25,
28 to 30).** The direction-blind and direction-carrying acceptance concepts do not exist in
this engine, for any frame-bound kind, new or enacted. On ground covered by a signed,
registered frame, an addition the frame does not draw is a deviation exactly like a missing
element, and the richness-is-a-floor acceptance doctrine is REPEALED as an AUTOMATIC
ACCEPTANCE, prospectively, in conformity with [2026] VJS-SC-OPBOX 1 order 17. The repeal is
of the automatic acceptance and of nothing else.

A deviation-by-addition is REMEDIALLY INERT as to removal. Its sole automatic consequence is
a proposed redraw; the addition remains live pending disposition; and it resolves by one of
exactly THREE routes: (i) a covering sign-off adopting it, (ii) an express registered
direction parking it under S-7D(2A), or (iii) a deletion that independently discharges
[2026] VJS-CC-OPBOX 155 O7. A signed frame's silence is never a deletion order. The drafted
text named route (i) alone and was struck as contrary to [2026] VJS-SC-OPBOX 1 order 19.

The repeal is executed as a MIGRATION and never as a deletion (order 28): each existing
acceptance row converts to a redraw record in `proposed`, carrying the original acceptance's
[2026] VJS-CC-OPBOX 155 O2 direction and magnitude as its brief, retains its render rights,
and may not be scored or reported as a deviation pending disposition. Acceptance is repealed
as a VERDICT and preserved as a RECORD: the direction and magnitude that carried each
acceptance are the successor regime's redraw brief, and a repeal that deleted them would
destroy the evidence the successor runs on. The state is closed PROSPECTIVELY at the parser
(order 29) - `AuthorityVerdict` is closed at three and `accepted` does not deserialise - and
existing rows remain readable for exactly one purpose, their conversion.

**WHERE THE REPEAL OPERATES, corrected on the record (order 24).** All three judges measured
the engine and found that `screen_parity` CARRIES NO ACCEPTANCE SURFACE: no acceptance state,
no excusal, no richness state, its comparison being a bare inequality that already scores a
richer code side as a difference. SUBMISSION-VDS-017 asserted such a surface in both of its
options and was WRONG AS FACT; option 1's consequence clause directing that the surface be
"removed in a follow-up amendment" is STRUCK as a direction reaching nothing, and no
follow-up amendment to `screen_parity` is owed. The acceptance surface the doctrine actually
occupies is in the CONSUMING repository - opbox-frontend's Figma richness pin on its pre-push
hook and the fifteen accepted-over rows in `scripts/frame-code-parity.py`'s baseline - and
the repeal reaches it under [2026] VJS-SC-OPBOX 1 orders 1 and 5 as a convergent
implementation of the register's rule, executed there as the migration above and never as a
deletion. The correction is RECORDED rather than quietly fixed, because a corpus that
mis-states where a doctrine lives is the defect the citation validator exists for. Fidelity
J's further amendment making `screen_parity` authority-aware commanded one judge and is
Schedule B item 8: NOT CARRIED, and available to a future submission.

**S-7D(5)** PROPOSED REDRAWS. A deviation routed back through the design is a redraw
record: the deviation, the proposed change described, a status of
`proposed | drawn | signed | withdrawn`, and the frame it belongs to. `signed` is lawful
ONLY with a `resolved_by` naming a sign-off row whose hash covers the change - the
frame's current hash, verified on every run. This is the machine-readable form of "add it
neatly later": the band comes back through the design, never through an exception.

**S-7D(2A) - DIRECTION ACTS ([2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 order 26).** A Principal direction that
disposes of a surface's conformance is ITSELF a sign-off act and enters the same register,
hash-bound to its LOGGED DECISION rather than to a frame's content ([2026] VJS-SC-OPBOX 1
orders 15, 30 and 31). A direction row records the log id, the digest of the logged decision,
the surface it touches (a route, or a file key and node id), its direction and magnitude in
the [2026] VJS-CC-OPBOX 155 O2 form, and the date. It carries authority while, and only
while, that digest equals the log entry's current digest: staleness by hash, never by trust,
on the same terms as a sign-off. A direction is taste exercised AT the register by the only
person entitled to exercise it, and not taste exercised downstream by an engine, which is the
distinction the constitutional direction turns on. An unregistered direction is not
instrument-readable authority: authority the instruments cannot read is authority the estate
does not have. The four directions of 2026-08-01 (flat containers; no floating on the
dotmatrix; sidebar to the frames' shell; band off-screen; LOG ids 103751, 103951, 104325,
104739) are the register's FOUNDING entries and are backfilled before any frame-bound proof
runs in blocking mode (order 32).

**S-7D(5A) - PARKED REDRAWS ([2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 order 27).** `RedrawStatus` admits a fifth
value, `parked`, lawful ONLY with a `directedBy` naming a direction row whose decision digest
still matches. A parked subject retains its render rights, is reported and never fatal, and
carries the direction's own words as its brief: while the registered direction stands, no
gate may count it a violation ([2026] VJS-SC-OPBOX 1 order 29). `withdrawn` means the
proposal was abandoned and the deviation stands, and is never used to record a direction.

**S-7D(6)** THE VISUAL REVIEW RECORD. The verdict artefact of an automated visual pass:
shipped-screenshot hash, the route's source digest at review time, frame-image hash, the
frame's content digest at review time, a delta list (each delta CLASSIFIED under S-7D(13)),
the reviewing agent's identity, and the date. A `conform` verdict also carries the
screenshot's PATH and the SERVED BUILD it was taken of, and must earn its claim under
S-7D(12). The engine validates, stores and stales the record; the capture and review
pipeline lives in the consuming repo, because a proof may not call a network or a model
(S-7(2)(1)). A verdict is evidence only while the shipped side, the frame side, AND the
authority all still hash to what was reviewed; any of the three moving ENDS the verdict,
visibly. A deviate verdict with no deltas, or a conform verdict with some, is incoherent
and refused: a verdict and its evidence may not disagree.

**S-7D(7) - ROUTE-SCOPED, NEVER FAMILY-SCOPED (SUBMISSION-VDS-018).** A verdict covers ONE
route. A verdict naming more than one confers coverage on NONE of them: it may be recorded
as evidence and it establishes nothing, and this is a validation rule rather than a
convention. The defect is measured, not imagined: a family-level pass covered a dashboard
family, scored one route inside it "capture debt, needs seeded data", and moved on. The
Principal then opened that route and found a counted facet row, a counted eyebrow, keyboard
affordances, date-group bands, rich row anatomy and a footer window statement drawn in the
frame, none of them shipped, and none of them needing data to find. The review was not wrong
about the family. It never studied the route, and nothing recorded that it had not. That is
the same class as a stale hand census and a depth-limited capture recording "no children" as
fact: ABSENCE OF STUDY IS INVISIBLE UNLESS THE INSTRUMENT ENUMERATES WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO
STUDY.

**S-7D(8) - DEPTH ON THE FACE OF THE ARTEFACT.** A verdict records WHICH regions of the pair
were examined - header, facets, body rows, rail, footer, empty state, keyboard - each with
the reviewer's finding or an explicit "not examined" and its reason. A verdict with an empty
region checklist is refused. A review that examined two bands and one that examined seven
must not be indistinguishable in the ledger: this is what makes triage visible AS triage,
and "not examined: capture debt" is a lawful and useful answer that must survive into the
record rather than dissolving into a verdict about the page.

**S-7D(9) - ENUMERATION AGAINST THE ESTATE'S MANIFEST.** The estate supplies a route
manifest (in the motivating project, its route tracker); VDS does not derive it, because
which routes are in the programme is the estate's question and not VDS's. The proof reports
every entry in one of THREE populations: routes with a CURRENT verdict, routes OWED BY DRIFT
(a verdict exists and the artefact or the contract moved under it), and routes NEVER
REVIEWED. The third is the one that matters, and it is a NAMED line per route, never a
count: coverage owed is [2026] VJS-SC-OPBOX 1 Q3's no_authority made countable - it neither
blocks nor licenses. Two structural consequences: the manifest is digest-witnessed, because
a route quietly deleted from it is a route that stops being reported as owed; and a run that
reports on fewer routes than it enumerated is REFUSED rather than published, because a
coverage report that quietly covers less than it claims is worse than none.

**S-7D(10) - THE FOUR-STAGE PIPELINE, AND WHY STAGES 3 AND 4 ARE NOT SUBSTITUTES.** The
design-checking pipeline is four stages in fixed order: (1) the machine-readable contract
derived from signed frames; (2) Figma AND code both built to that contract, Figma being
where it is authored and signed and code being where it is implemented; (3) source-side
gates, enforced per push; (4) the artefact-side visual check, per route. `visual_review` is
STAGE 4 and is not an audit bolted on beside the gates.

The stages are LINKED, not parallel. A stage-4 verdict cites the stage-1 contract version it
was taken against - the sign-off row whose hash is the frame it compared to - and the
citation is checked against the register: the row must exist, sign that frame, and carry the
hash the verdict says it used. A verdict that cannot name its contract version is invalid,
because that is exactly how "we checked it" survives a contract change with nobody noticing.
Only a `no_authority` verdict may omit the citation, that being the state of having no
contract to cite.

STAGE 3 AND STAGE 4 ARE NOT SUBSTITUTES, and neither may be cited as covering the other's
ground. Gates read SOURCE and cannot see the page; the visual check reads the PAGE and is
slow and sampled. This is the sentence that would have prevented the motivating failure,
where twenty-eight green stage-3 gates were read as evidence about stage 4 and the pages
looked nothing like their frames.

**S-7D(11) - COMMENCEMENT AND CONDITION PRECEDENT ([2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1 orders 33 to 36).**
S-7D commences on enactment and the sign-off register is a CONDITION PRECEDENT to any
frame-bound proof running in blocking mode. S-7B and S-7C are independent of the register and
commence at once. S-7A(5)'s authority limb and S-7D(6) both call the register and have NO
blocking effect until a surface's own frame is registered: the flip from report to block is
PER SURFACE at the moment of that frame's registration, and never estate-wide - there is no
flag day. Only frames labelled CURRENT SOURCE are registrable; LEGACY/REFERENCE,
TARGET/proposal and self-disclaiming frames are no_authority per se and are registrable only
after redraw, and `vds signoff record` refuses them at the front door (order 31), which
creates no proof rule and reddens nothing already recorded. S-5(9) commences on enactment and
is inert until register records carry `directedAt` or `measuredBy`; the I4 census is the
instrument that keeps that inertness visible. While the register is empty every frame-bound
verdict resolves no_authority - coverage owed, never green - which is the correct posture
between the judgment and the register's first row.

**S-7D(12) - A CONFORM VERDICT EARNS ITS CLAIM, OR IT IS NOT ONE.** A `conform` verdict is
refused unless it names a SCREENSHOT PATH whose file still hashes to the screenshot digest
it records, names the SERVED BUILD the screenshot was taken of, and examined at least one
band. The defect is measured, not imagined: the whole conform branch of the proof was one
line marking the row enforced, and three of these four conditions were demonstrated on the
downstream estate by MINTING a passing record, each one alone enough to conjure a route at
parity out of nothing; the fourth was found in landed records. Each limb closes a different
hole. Without the path nothing in the record can be re-derived from an artefact, so the
verdict rests on two hashes of three and the missing one is the picture of the product.
Without a matching re-hash the field is present and the evidence is gone. Without the served
build the shipped source digest is computed from the LOCAL TREE and can describe code the
screenshot never ran. And a checklist in which every row says `examined: false` is a
perfectly well-formed record that says NOBODY LOOKED. The rule reaches `conform` and NOTHING
ELSE: a deviate verdict claims no parity, and holding it to a parity standard would make
recording a deviation dearer than recording nothing, which is how an estate stops recording
deviations. It is a defect in the RECORD, curable by the recorder, so it is fatal in every
authority state, with R1, R6 and R11.

**S-7D(13) - A DELTA IS CLASSIFIED, AND THE CLASS CITES ITS ROW.** Each delta carries a
DISPOSITION from a closed set of seven - `code_defect`, `frame_behind_product`,
`frame_draws_annotation`, `shipped_is_better`, `needs_absent_data`, `belongs_to_app_chrome`,
`forbidden_by_policy` - and the field is required, so an unclassified delta is refused by the
DESERIALISER rather than disapproved of by a rule. A bare list answered "what differs" and
nothing else, so a frame drawn before a product decision, an annotation the exporter drew
into the image, a band nobody seeded data for and a genuine code defect were one population
with one queue. Every disposition that asserts the work lives SOMEWHERE ELSE must cite the
row that carries it - a redraw (`RDW-`) for the three frame-side kinds, a screen record
(`SCR-`) for app chrome, a prohibition or direction (`PRB-`/`DIR-`) for a policy bar - and
the two that are claims about the artefacts the verdict already names cite nothing. Without
the citation the taxonomy is seven synonyms for "not now".

There is deliberately NO `accepted` and NO `wont_fix`, and there never will be. An acceptance
state is taste exercised after sign-off, and taste is exercised once, AT sign-off: a fourth
value here would be a fourth `AuthorityVerdict` wearing a different field name, reachable by
the recorder rather than by the signer. EVERY disposition leaves the verdict `deviate` and
leaves R5 RED. A DISPOSITION CLASSIFIES AND NEVER DISPOSES. An invalid delta refuses the
whole record, and an invalid record CONFERS NO COVERAGE, so its route returns to the
never-reviewed population by name.

**S-7D(14) - REGION CORRESPONDENCE, AND THE DECLARATION IT NEEDS.** A screen record's
arrangement contract gains `bands`: which of the CLOSED review bands that screen has. It is a
different list from `regions` and not a duplicate: `regions` is the SUBJECT's own vocabulary
and is deliberately open (S-5A), and an open set cannot refuse a name that is not a band, so
it cannot be the correspondence key. A reviewer who EXAMINED a band the screen does not
declare has made a finding about another screen, and in the ledger that reads as depth; that
is R14 and it is fatal. A band recorded `examined: false` is never foreign: the rule reads
STUDY, not paperwork.

The rule is asked in two steps and the ORDER is part of it. Where no screen record claims the
route, or the record declares no bands, the correspondence CANNOT RUN: that is reported per
route, counted as a skipped row, and summarised on the face of every run as "ran on N, could
not run on M". A rule that cannot run must not read as a rule that ran and found nothing - on
the estate this was written for the same check could only run on 17 rows of 160 - and one
number holding both facts would have reported 143 unmeasured routes as clean. `bands` is NOT
required and empty is the honest default, because a rule that went permanently red on every
screen registered before the field existed is a rule people switch off.

**S-7(6)** Adding a proof kind is an amendment to this specification and to the invariant
registry, not a script anyone may drop in. The registry is closed for the same reason VJS
closed its predicate registry: an open registry is a free-form script surface, and a
free-form script surface is not a gate.

**S-7(7)** The proof surface is the one that rots. VJS holds 173 decision logs against 3
proof records, measured at drafting. VDS's entire value rests on the proof surface, so
capture is wired into the checker under S-7(2)(5) rather than left to be written by hand,
and S-11(4) makes the ratio itself a checked condition.

---

## S-8 The enforcement lock

**S-8(1)** `.vds/enforcement.lock` pins the proof-script surface by digest, and is held
outside the scripts it witnesses. It moves the integrity witness out of the mutable surface
it guards: a weakening edit bumps a digest and trips a loud, blocking finding rather than
passing under its own possibly weakened logic.

**S-8(2)** Each entry names a path, its sha256, its kind, what invokes it, which proof
kinds it produces, and the test that proves its failing direction. The last field is what
makes S-7(2)(2) structural rather than aspirational.

**S-8(3)** The lock is opt-in. A repository with no lock file produces no drift finding, so
an unpinned project is quiet rather than broken. But a warrant may not cite a proof whose
script is absent from a present lock.

**S-8(4)** Drift is fatal. Re-pinning is deliberate: re-lock only after a recorded gate
change, and self-file the rationale under S-12(3).

**S-8(5)** What the lock cannot do, stated plainly rather than glossed. It cannot bind an
author with full write access who edits a gate and re-locks it in the same act. The
backstops for that residue are non-machine: the Principal's gate and the duty of reasonable
care. VDS records this as a named remainder, not as a solved problem, and no VDS document
may claim the enforcement surface is tamper-proof.

**S-8(6)** The positive direction of the drift check is itself tested: a test edits a
pinned file and asserts a fatal finding. Without it the lock proves only that unmodified
files are unmodified.

## S-9 Amendment and retirement of a registered component

**S-9(1)** A register with no exit rule rots, because the only lawful move becomes adding.
This section is the exit rule. A record is never deleted and an identifier is never reused.

### Amendment

**S-9(2)** Any change to a registered component's contract is an amendment, recorded in
`amendments[]` with `at`, `by`, `kind`, `what`, and the proof or warrant that supports it.
`contractVersion` increments on every amendment.

**S-9(3)** A **non-breaking** amendment adds an optional prop, adds a state to `drawn` or
`built`, tightens a contrast floor, or corrects a factual field such as `demand` or a
source path. It requires a decision log under S-12(2) and a passing `reconciliation` proof.
It does not require a warrant.

**S-9(4)** A **breaking** amendment removes or renames a prop, removes a required state,
changes a role or accessible-name source, or **lowers a contrast floor**. It requires a
warrant, because the surface it invalidates is the surface a warrant was granted over.

**S-9(5) Anti-relaxation.** A floor may be tightened by any project. A floor may never be
loosened below the designpack floor it inherits, and an attempt to do so is dropped at load
with a defect recorded, not merely warned about. Where a lower floor is genuinely correct
(for example because SC 1.4.11 does not reach a purely decorative rule), the correct move is
to change the component's **scope**, not its floor: record that the component is decoration
and carries no control boundary, with the basis stated. That is a factual claim a reviewer
can contest, whereas a quietly lowered floor is not.

### Retirement

**S-9(6)** Retirement is three phases and cannot be compressed.

1. **Supersession notice.** The record moves to `status: deprecated`, sets `deprecatedAt`,
   and sets `supersededBy` to the successor's id, or to `null` where the component is
   withdrawn outright with no replacement. From this moment the `composition` proof reports
   every consuming site as a warning, per site, by route. A deprecated component never
   passes silently.
2. **Drain.** `demand.routes` must reach zero, measured by the named command, not asserted.
   A `retirement_drain` proof records the measurement and its digest. While any consumer
   remains, retirement is refused: the proof exits non-zero and no warrant may be granted
   over the register in that state.
3. **Tombstone.** On a passing drain proof the record moves to `status: retired`, sets
   `retiredAt` and `retirementProofId`, and is kept forever. The identifier is never
   reused. The tombstone is what makes a `supersedes` chain readable years later, and it is
   why `supersedes` is an array: a successor may absorb several predecessors.

**S-9(7)** The successor named in `supersededBy` must itself be `registered` or later
before the predecessor may be deprecated. Deprecating toward a component that does not yet
exist is how a library ends up with two incomplete halves and no whole.

**S-9(8)** A retired record remains valid against the schema and remains readable by every
proof. `reconciliation` treats a retired record's absence from the codebase as correct, and
its **presence** in the codebase as a violation. That inversion is the point: after
retirement, the code being there is the defect.

**S-9(9)** The absolute drain of S-9(6)(2) is the default and the ONLY executive path -
settled by [2026] VJS-CC-VIBE-DESIGN-SYSTEM 5 H1 (answering `SUBMISSION-VDS-004`). A
retirement may complete over non-zero demand only under an order of the court that names
the remaining demand - each route, each count - on its face, sets the date, and states why
breakage-on-a-date is preferred to the hostage state. An executive deadline alone can
never force it: the party wanting the retirement declaring the breakage acceptable is
self-certification, and a court cannot be asked to order over demand it has not been
shown.

**S-9(10)** The primitive floor, settled by [2026] VJS-CC-VIBE-DESIGN-SYSTEM 5 (answering
`SUBMISSION-VDS-005`): an ENUMERATED SET of elements is below the register's floor, held in
the composition gate's own source where the enforcement lock pins it - so a change to the
set is a re-pin with a rationale, an ordinary governed edit a diff can show. Elements in
the set are informational rows, counted and excluded from `rows_enforced`. A bare element
OUTSIDE the set - the interactive tags a design system exists to govern - is an
unregistered component wearing an element's name and fails the proof, unless it appears in
the project's named carve-out list, where every use is counted and reported by site.
Failing bare elements wholesale is forbidden: a gate that cries wolf gets disabled.

---

## S-10 Referral to VJS

**S-10(1)** Every judgement call routes to VJS. The referral path is a submission under
`schema/submission.schema.json`, filed into `.vds/submissions/filed/` with the VJS
submission id, and answered by a VJS order whose citation and ratio are recorded back onto
the submission.

**S-10(2)** Before filing, the citator is checked. A submission must list every near
authority considered and say why each is not on all fours. A submission that skips the
citator check re-litigates settled law and is defective, and the schema requires at least
one citator entry for exactly this reason.

**S-10(3)** Referral is for the enumerated triggers only: a first-impression point, a
genuine distinction from an existing ratio, a proposal to overrule a precedent, an
instruction that conflicts with the designpack, or a discovered breach. Everything else is
a decision log under S-12(2).

**S-10(4)** Every operative citation in a warrant must resolve to a defined object. The
check is existence-only and never reads what the cited authority says. An unresolved
citation is a fatal finding.

**S-10(5)** A convening record pins the bench and the case file by digest, and the
resulting warrant repeats the same `case_file_digest`, so what was decided on is provable
after the fact.

**S-10(6)** VDS holds no appellate function. An appeal from a VJS order answering a VDS
submission runs in VJS, by VJS's own tiers, and VDS records the outcome.

---

## S-11 Accession, versioning and locks

**S-11(1)** `.vds/designpack.lock` carries `designpack_id`, `designpack_version`, `digest`,
`schema_version`, `generated_at` and `locked_by`. Adoption is vendored, read-only,
digest-pinned and fail-closed. The runtime never fetches doctrine.

**S-11(2)** A loader refuses, loudly and at load time, any designpack whose
`schema_version` exceeds what it understands. A loader that skips clauses it cannot parse
is silently lawless.

**S-11(3)** A digest bump is a deliberate recorded act. No doctrine flows downstream by
silence.

**S-11(4)** `.vds/install.lock` carries `schema_version`, `generated_at`, `config_digest`,
`hooks[]`, `hook_digests[]` and `adapters[]`, so a missing or altered hook is itself a
finding rather than a quiet absence.

**S-11(5)** Two front doors, exactly one wall. Any CLI, editor plugin, MCP verb or Figma
integration is a convenience door over one checker binary. The wall is the gate that runs
whether or not the door was used. "The author used the tool" is never proof of conformance.

---

## S-12 Permits, decisions and breaches

**S-12(1)** A governed write needs a permit: scoped by path glob, carrying its obligations
by id, expiring, and closed by proof. The lifecycle is
`route -> permit -> obligations -> proof -> log -> validate`.

**S-12(2)** A reversible call with low blast radius is a decision log, not a referral. The
log carries `court_required: false` and `why`, which is what records that a fork was
considered and disposed without a sitting. This is what keeps referral cheap enough to
actually use.

**S-12(3)** A self-reported breach is a first-class record with a fixed schema:
`what_happened`, `law_breached[]` with each entry citing an instrument, `discovered_by`,
`containment`, `remedy[]`. Remedy is restorative, not punitive: the work is made good and
the lawful route resumed.

**S-12(4)** The two defects at S-1(4) are the founding breach entries, and they are filed
as breaches rather than described as background, because a system whose first act is to
excuse the failures that motivated it has taught itself the wrong lesson.

---

## S-13 Reserved matters, collected

Every clause that depends on an unsettled point, with its submission. Nothing here may be
implemented until the submission is answered, and no VDS document may state a ruling on
any of them.

| clause | question | submission |
|---|---|---|
| S-6(5), SETTLED by [2026] VJS-CC-VIBE-DESIGN-SYSTEM 4 | may W1 be granted provisionally on a greenfield surface | `SUBMISSION-VDS-001` |
| S-6(6), SETTLED by [2026] VJS-CC-VIBE-DESIGN-SYSTEM 4 | who may grant W2, given composition is fully machine-checkable | `SUBMISSION-VDS-002` |
| S-3(6), SETTLED by [2026] VJS-CC-VIBE-DESIGN-SYSTEM 4 | does a designpack bind one project, a tenant, or the realm | `SUBMISSION-VDS-003` |
| S-9(9), SETTLED by [2026] VJS-CC-VIBE-DESIGN-SYSTEM 5 | may a component be retired against a forced-drain deadline while consumers remain | `SUBMISSION-VDS-004` |
| S-9(10), SETTLED by [2026] VJS-CC-VIBE-DESIGN-SYSTEM 5 | where the primitive floor sits for the composition proof | `SUBMISSION-VDS-005` |
| S-2(8), SETTLED by [2026] VJS-FI-VDS 1 | is a court record filed under `.vds/court/**` within the reach of S-2(8), and does shape-only matching satisfy it | `DECISION-0009`, referred up; no submission filed |

---

## S-14 Cost, stated honestly

**S-14(1)** The register is the expensive part, and it is expensive whether or not VDS
exists, because it is just "write down every component and what it must do". Anyone
proposing to skip VDS to avoid that cost has not avoided it: they have decided not to write
it down, which is the state that produced both defects at S-1(4).

**S-14(2)** What VDS adds on top of the register is the gating, which is comparatively
cheap, and the proofs, most of which are small scripts of the kind already written in this
project. Two of the twelve proof kinds exist today in some form.

> **Superseded on this point by S-14A(3): all eleven are implemented.** S-14(2) is left as
> written because it is a COST FORECAST made at drafting, and a statute that quietly edits its
> own forecasts to match the outcome cannot be checked against what it predicted. The number
> here is history; S-14A(3) is the current state. Read them in that order.

**S-14(3)** What VDS adds in ongoing cost, stated so nobody is surprised: every new
component needs a record before it may be used; every contract change needs an amendment
entry; every warrant re-runs its proofs when the surface changes; and the reconciliation
proof will fail on day one and keep failing until the register is genuinely complete. That
last one is a feature and will not feel like one.

**S-14(4)** What VDS does not buy: it does not make the design good, it does not reduce the
work of designing, and it does not remove the need for the Principal to look at the screens.
It converts a class of silent failure into a loud one at authoring time. That is the whole
return, and it is worth the cost only because the failures in that class are the ones that
reach production and stay there for months.

---

## S-14A The implementation

**S-14A(1)** VDS is implemented as a Rust workspace producing one binary, `vds`, on a pinned
toolchain. This is not a free choice: VJS is a Rust workspace, VDS refers every judgement call
to VJS (S-1(2)), and two governance systems with one purpose and two toolchains is the
fragmentation the pair exists to avoid.

**S-14A(2)** Every closed set this specification fixes is a type rather than a validated
string. A tenth state (S-5(3)), a status outside the lifecycle (S-5(4)), a proof kind outside
the registry (S-7(5)) and a `capture_mode` other than `automatic` (S-7(2)(5)) are each
unrepresentable rather than invalid. Where a rule can be made structural it is made
structural, because a rule enforced at runtime is a rule that can be reached with the check
disabled.

**S-14A(3)** All fifteen proof kinds at S-7(5) are implemented and enacted ([2026] VJS-CA-VDS 1; the registry is closed at fifteen and no sixteenth kind was created). `unimplemented_because` is kept on
the type rather than deleted: a kind that later has to be withdrawn must record WHY, per kind,
rather than disappearing from a match arm, and the difference between work and a dependency is
what tells a reader which it is. What remains unbuilt is a pin GENERATOR: `token_pin` checks a
pin and nothing in this build produces one, because one of the two records it compares is
behind a network call S-7(2)(1) forbids inside a proof. Its runs are `vacuous` and say so.

---

## S-15 Commencement

**S-15(1)** This specification does not commence on being written. It commences when a
dated, digest-pinned assent event exists in `designpack/v1/provenance/assent/` naming this
document's digest, and `.vds/designpack.lock` pins the pack containing it.

**S-15(2)** Until commencement, no warrant may be granted, because there is nothing to grant
one under.

**S-15(3)** The five reserved matters at S-13 do not block commencement. They block the
clauses that depend on them, and those clauses fail closed in the meantime: strict W1, W2
referred, absolute drain, informational-only bare elements, and single-project binding.
